### MT car dataset

> Data was provided by coursera which showed 10 aspects of automobile design and perfromance factor . Using this
  we are able to apply linear reg using 2 vs 3 variables form the data set. Given below are facots and values
```{r}
library(datasets)
head(mtcars, 3)
```

## mtcars dataset - Format
>In the current app it shows 5 performance factos such as MPG , HP , Cylinder and fuel comsumption. Using this factor linear reg is done

## Analysis - main code

```r
  formulaTextPoint <- reactive({
    paste("mpg ~", "as.integer(", input$variable, ")")  })
  
  fit <- reactive({
    lm(as.formula(formulaTextPoint()), data=mpgData)  })
  ...
  output$fit <- renderPrint({
    summary(fit()) })
  
  output$mpgPlot <- renderPlot({
    with(mpgData, {
      plot(as.formula(formulaTextPoint()))
      abline(fit(), col=2)
    })  })
```
